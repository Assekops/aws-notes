-General Purpose
Provide balance of compute, memory and networking resources.
Use case: Ideal for applications that use resources in equal proportion, such as web servers and code repository.

-Compute Optimized
Ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors.
Use cases: Batch processing workloads, media transcoding, machine learning interface, and other compute-intensive applications.

-Memory Optimized
Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory.

-Accelerated Computing
Use hardware accelerator, or co-processors, to perform functions such as floating-point calculation, graphical processing, or data pattern matching.

-Storage Optimized
Designed for workloads that require high, sequencial read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of IOPS to applications.
